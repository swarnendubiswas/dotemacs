##emacs

My emacs changes, all in one place. Most of the information here is collected from different sources on the Internet,
dressed with my choices.

#####Directory structure:
         + backup -- older changes
         * lisp -- third-party packages (not from archives)
         - modules -- personal customizations
         * theme -- custom themes

The backup directory contains older monolithic startup files, which I no longer use. I am now using [`(use-package)`](https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package).

Suggestions are welcome.

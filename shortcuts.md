## Useful keyboard shortcuts

This file lists useful keyboard shortcuts that might be difficult to remember. These keybindings are mostly from a
default installation of GNU Emacs, so the keybindings listed here should also be available in the reference cards. I am
maintaining this for my ease of reference.

Use `M-x describe-personal-keybindings` to see personal keybindings defined using `bind-key`.

;;; Commentary:

;; This package helps synchronizing the recent files list between Emacs
;; instances.  Without it, each Emacs instance manages its own recent files
;; list.  The last one to close persistently saves its list into
;; `recentf-save-file'; all files recently opened by other instances are
;; overwritten.
;;
;; With sync-recentf, all running Emacs instances periodically synchronize their
;; local recent files list with `recentf-save-file'.  This ensures that all
;; instances share the same list, which is persistently saved across sessions.

;; `sync-recentf-marker' is always pushed on top of `recentf-list' when it is
;; synchronized, after a load from `recentf-save-file' or an explicit merge.
;;
;; All files appearing before `sync-recentf-marker' in `recentf-list' were
;; visited after the last synchronization, meaning that they should be pushed up
;; in the next synchronization phase.  Synchronization actually happens at file
;; save (see `recentf-save-list') or during periodical cleanups (see
;; `recentf-cleanup')

;; If you make improvements to this code or have suggestions, please do not
;; hesitate to fork the repository or submit bug reports on github.  The
;; repository is at:

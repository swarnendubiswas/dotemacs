;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This code is heavily based on Steve Purcell's ibuffer-vc
;; (http://github.com/purcell/ibuffer-vc).
;;
;; Adds functionality to ibuffer for grouping buffers by their TRAMP
;; connection.
;;
;;; Use:
;;
;; To group buffers by TRAMP connection:
;;
;;   M-x ibuffer-tramp-set-filter-groups-by-tramp-connection
;;
;; or, make this the default:
;;
;;   (add-hook 'ibuffer-hook
;;     (lambda ()
;;       (ibuffer-tramp-set-filter-groups-by-tramp-connection)
;;       (ibuffer-do-sort-by-alphabetic)))
;;
;; Alternatively, use `ibuffer-tramp-generate-filter-groups-by-tramp-connection'
;; to programmatically obtain a list of filter groups that you can
;; combine with your own custom groups.
